# app-lifecycle-demo

Ohk so far you can view pull the code and view it yourself , ya i vibe coded some stuff because am lazy to write two lines of get / post request code.  
Hey, but i know how it works though.  
So, i wrote a simple docker file from refering docker official documentation [Dockerfile basics](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/building-images/writing-a-dockerfile/)

Then for now am not implemented docker volume so if you build the container now and use it, you cant see any data now.  
So thats where am i write now i'll be learning along the way and update the code and the readme .

So if you have any issue you notice or some probelm you see you can raise the issue :).
